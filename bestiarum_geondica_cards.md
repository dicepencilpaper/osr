# Bestiarum Geondica - Playing card edition

These tables are based on the original [Bestiarum Geondica](https://natetreme.itch.io/bestiarum) by [Highland Paranormal Society](https://natetreme.itch.io/). The original tables go from 11 to 66. Since there are more cards than that, I took the liberty of adding more creatures and descriptions to each table.

Let me know what you think!

## Monster tables
